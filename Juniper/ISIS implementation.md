# Attached Bit

Level 1 routers install a 0.0.0.0/0 default route to the metrically closest
attached router when they detect Level 1 LSPs with the attached bit set.
You can disable the generation of a default route by including the
**ignore-attached-bit** statement at the [edit protocols isis] configuration
hierarchy.

# Costs

IS-IS generates two (TLV) tuples, one for an IS-IS adjacency and the second for an IP prefix.
To allow IS-IS to support traffic engineering, a second pair of TLVs has been added to IS-IS, one for IP prefixes and the second for IS-IS adjacency and traffic engineering information.
With these TLVs, IS-IS metrics can have values up to 16,777,215 (224 â€“ 1).

By default, Junos OS supports the sending and receiving of wide metrics.
Junos OS allows a maximum metric value of 63 and generates both pairs of TLVs.
To configure IS-IS to generate only the new pair of TLVs and thus to allow the wider range of metric values,
you must include the wide-metrics-only statement in the IS-IS configuration.


# Overload

In overload mode, the routing device advertisement is originated with all the transit routing device links (except stub)
set to a metric of  metric of 0xFFFF

The *advertise-high-metric* setting is only valid while the routing device is in overload mode.
When *advertise-high-metric* is configured, IS-IS does not set the overload bit.
Rather, it sets the metric to 63 or 16,777,214, depending whether wide metrics are enabled.
This allows the overloaded routing device to be used for transit as a last resort.
