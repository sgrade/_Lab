S3 endpoint in VPC
Full Access - Allow access by any user or service within the VPC using credentials from any AWS accounts to any resources in this AWS service. All policies — IAM user policies, VPC endpoint policies, and AWS service-specific policies (e.g. Amazon S3 bucket policies, any S3 ACL policies) — must grant the necessary permissions for access to succeed.

pip install awscli
