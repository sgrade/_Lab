AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Speciality
Module 3: Configure Network Integration with Application Services. 1.0.1

Services: Route 53, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, Lambda@Edge

Route 53
  Domain registrar: Amazon registrar or Gandi
  Health Checks: http/https, TCP, string matching; Status of CloudWatch alarms; Status of other health checks
  Traffic flow: 
    Traffic Policy
    Traffic policy records
    Traffic Endpoints
  Examples
    Simple Routing Policy - health
    Weighted Routing Policy: route to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. Blue/green deployments...
    Combinign Routing Policy: health + weight
    Geo-Fencing: if you are in Europe, go to this location
    Geolocation Routing Policy: Location is [Continent[Country[Subdivision]]]
    Latency Routing Policy: how far is your client from the regions, which I set. 
      Note: the client and DNS resolver it uses (e.g. OpenDNS) may be in the different locations. 
      The resolver can implement DNS extension, which puts the client's IP in the DNS request. Not many implement this, but if it 
      is implemented, Route 53 can check the client IP.
      Use case: Cross-Region Failover: Latency rule + Helth-check
    Geoproximity Routing Policy
      Latency-based (fine tuned). I can move bias (e.g. +50) - tune. Use latitude/longtitude.
    Multi-Value Answer Routing Policy - return multiple addresses on one request. So, clients behind the DNS resolver can be balanced.
  Private DNS in VPC
  Hybrid DNS - integration between on-premises and AWS
    From on-premises to AWS: conditional forwarders to redirect queries from on-premises to AWS
      E.g. Request from on-premises client goes to a Microsoft AD server in VPC, which redirects it to Route53 resolver (+2 address in 
        a VPC network), then the responce goes back. 
    From AWS to on-premises: VPC Directory Services forwards to redirect queries to on-premises DNS forwarders

Elastic Load Balancing
  Flavors: Classic, Application, Network
  
  Classic Load Balancer
    TCP, HTTP/HTTPS
    Supports EC2 Classic as well as VPC
    Operates on Layer 4
    Disadvantages: cannot balance between different ports on the same EC2 instance; one load balancer per DNS name; 
      register EC2 instances in the load balancer itself - so, you cannot choose interface
  
  Application Load Balancer
    Overview
      Routing decisions on Application Layer (layer 7)
      Ideal for HTTP/HTTPS
      Advanced routing targeted at delivery of modern application architectures
    Advantages: 
      One load balancer for several DNS names; register
      EC instances in target groups (roles: images - one target group, orders - another target group); 
      Can share EC2 instances between target groups
      Integrages with Auto Scaling to manage the scaling of each target group independently; 
      Full integration with Amazon ECS (EC2 Container Servers) - containers means more than one port on the EC2 instance
      ECS will automatically register tasks with the load balancer using a dynamic port mapping
      Can be used with other container technologies
      Containers can be included in the target group
      Host-based routing
        Based on host field in HTTP header
    Integration with WAF
      Available not in every region
      Blacklist based on conditions, e.g. IP addresses. Note: normal network ACLs on EC2 instance support not many IP addresses
    Pre-defined Serucity Policies (cannot be modified, like on Classic Load Balancer). Specify which cyphers clients can use (TLS 1.0/ 
      TLS 1.1/ 1.2., SSL)
    Server Name Indication (SNI)
      The load balancer need to return right certificate to establish TLS connection.
      Part of the TLS protocol itself. There is a specific SNI header, which helps us choose right sertificate. 
    Application Load Balancer Sample Architecture
      Load balancer -> Listeners -> For each Listener Rules (e.g. everything that contains */img/* should be sent to target group) -> 
        target group (EC2 instances, ECS (EC2 Container Server), IP (see below)) -> Health checks
      IP as a target
        You can send traffic to on-premise servers. If there is a traffic spike, then send some traffic to Amazon.
  
  Network Load Balancer
    Overview
      Routing decisions on Transport Layer (Layer 4)
      Millions of requests per second, ultra-low latencies
      Uses a single static IP address per AZ
      Ability to add External IP
    Features
      Implemented in the AWS network stack (there is no need to provision extra appliance in the AWS backend)
        Can help with firewall ports
      Source IP preserved
      Integrated with Auto Scaling and Amazon ECS
      Health checks at TCP/application level
    Static IP
      Assign an Elastic IP per AZ to get Static IP
      Helps with white-listing firewalls
    AZ Fail-over
      Throuth DNS in Route53
    Cross-zone load balancing
      Disabled by default, but you can enable it
      You have two load balancers (one per AZ). However each of them can send requests to both zones' EC2 instances.
      Because you cannot control DNS requests, without cross-zone EC2 instances behind one of the load balancers can be overloaded. 
        With cross-zone, it is not the case
      Don't enable it if you care about latency. And if you care about price - traffic between AZs cost money.
    Network Load Balancer Architecture
      NLB -> Listeners -> targets (EC2 instances or IP addresses)
