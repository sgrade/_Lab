AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Speciality
Module 6: Manage, Optimize, and Troubleshoot the Network

Monitoring
  Amazon CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs

Optimization
  Enable Enhanced Networksing
    SR-IOV, no additional charge, available on certain instance ttypes
  Placement groups
    Logical grouping of instance types; recommended for applications tht benefit from low latency
  Jumbo MTU
    1500 is the largest MTU for most of the Internate; available on many instance types
    Need to be enabled as a rule inside the security group
    Cannot leave VPC
  DirectConnect for performance
    In comparison to VPN gives more performance; no jitter (VPN will go over the Internet, so there is a jitter)
  Optimizing for cost
    Internet versus Direct Connect egress - DX charge is cheaper in terms of data transfer, but also take into account price of getting 
      to the DX location
    Inter-region data transfer out
      Inside the region use private IPs to avoid data transfer costs!
        So whithin AZ with private IPs no cost.
      Within AZ if you use public IPs, there will be data transfer cost, because traffic will go up and back (?IGW?)
      Between AZ with private AZ - there is a charge (for example, in case of cross-zone load balancing)

Troubleshooting
  Load testing
    ELB with Auto Scaling groups - you need to test those
    Tools like Bees with Machine Guns are useful
  Tcpdump and PCAP
    Can be used on AWS instances (EC2); -W parameter allows captures to file (to be used with Wireshark)
  Agent-based
