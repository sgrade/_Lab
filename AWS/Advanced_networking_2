AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Speciality
Module 2: Design and Implement Hybrid IT Network Architectures. 1.0.1

Connectivity options: public internet, VPN, DirectConnect

VPN
  Site-to-site VPN
    AWS managed VPN (VGW - virtual private gateway)
      Built-in HA. Amazon gives 2 IP addresses for 2 tunnels. So two VGWs connect to one customer gateway.
      To avoid asymmetric routing: prepend as-path or set MED attribute
      Cloud hop - when two corporate datacenters speak via VGW
      Important points:
        VGW doesn't initiate IPSec connection (thus, we cannot connect two VGW together)
        On-demand dead peer detection (DPD): 10 seconds -> send "R-U-THERE" message -> if no response to 3 DPD, terminated
        One PSK per tunnel
      Accessing resources:
        Can reach private IPs, EC2, RDS, RedShift, Lambda
        Can't access: NLB, EFS, VPC endpoints, VPC DNS IP, AWS public IP range. 
          Reason - you need to talk to something with ENI to access those resources.
      Monitoring with CloudWatch: TunnelState, TunnelDataIn, TunnelDataOut
      Up to 1.25 Gbps per tunnel
    EC2: Something on top of Amazon EC2 instance (self-managed; self-managed HA and scalability)
      BYO software: AWS Marketplace, open-source
      Roughly about 2-2.5 Gbps
      Detect failures: EC2 healthchecks, BFD, ping
      Failover: some products from AWS marketplace can talk to AWS API -> move elastic IPs, change routing table, ...
      Load balancing self-managed
      Accessing resources: private IPs by default; the rest with NAT (you NAT incoming traffic from on-premise resources)
      Horizontal scaling: You can scale up, but at some point you hit the 2-2.5 Gbps limit. So, scale out:
        Route per on-premise destination. 
        Attach different VPN GWs to different VPC subnets. 
        Separate router and VPN GWs (use EC2 instance to route traffic between several VPN Gateways). 
          Then the router can handle more traffic as it doesn't need to do encryption/decription.
          To make it redundant, place the VPN GWs in different AZs, connect the router and the VPN GWs with GRE tunnels.
      
  Client-to-site VPN
    VGW doesn't support client-to-site VPN
    Host VPN software on EC2 instances.
    Load balance: client software, DNS-based (Router 53)
    
  VPN use cases
    On-premise to Amazon
      IPSec - AWS managed VPN
      Non-IPSec - (GRE, DMVPN) - EC2 software VPN
      Advanced threat protection (DLP, IPS, IDS, etc.) - Amazon EC2 software VPN
    L3 encryption
      Between EC2 instances - host-based VPN sw
      Over AWS direct connect - no support for TLS - AWS managed VPN over public VIF
    Multicast
      Amazon doesn't support it. Use GRE tunneling on end hosts.
####

DirectConnect (DX)
  Now if you connected to one DX location, you get access to all AWS resources globally (in all regions).
  Physical connectivity options:
    Customer router in the same DX location
    Curcuit between customer DC and DX location
    Curcuit between customer DC and service provider
  Set up: choose location, choose speed (1/10 with multiple virtual interfaces or 
    sub-1G from partners with 1 virtual interface). Download letter of authorization.
  Physical connectivity: 1000Base-LS or 10GBASE-LR; network must support VLANs and BGP; 
    BFD recommended for fast failure detection and failover
  Connecting to VPCs
    Private VIFs (one per VLAN) to connect to VPCs. Public VIFs to connect to public AWS resources. BGP connection for each VIF.
    Using DirectConnect gateway (DGW). Only one VLAN and BGP connection is required. DGW will route traffic to required region.
  Public VIF
    All Amazon public IPs will be advertised to client via BGP. Filter routes as appropriate. Subscribe for SNS for changes.
      Use BGP communities to identify local/remote routes.
    To advertise to AWS set BGP community tag on each public prefix to define the scope:
      7224:9100 - local AWS region
      7224:9200 - local continent
      7224:9300 - Global
    AWS DirectConnect applies the following BGP community tags
      7224:8100 - local AWS region
      7224:8200 - local continent
      No Tag - Global
