# OPNFV joid install on VMs

# 0. Prerequisites:
# maas server installed
# we use maas-cli, so it is installed (on a management desktop - NOT on maas server), maas profile configured (e.g. maas-server)
# virtualization host (e.g. sandbox1) saltified and configured for maas
# virtualization host is configured in maas as virsh pod

# Get maas pod id
maas maas-server pods read

# in our case pod id is 6
	Machine-readable output follows:
	[
		{
	...
		   "name": "sandbox1",
	...
			],
			"id": 6
		}
	]


# Compose jump node on virtualization host under maas management
maas maas-server pod compose 6 cores=2 memory=8192 hostname=joid

	Success.
	Machine-readable output follows:
	{
		"system_id": "gdp33h",
		"resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/machines/gdp33h/"
	}

# Wait until the jump node is commissioned by maas (2-3 minutes for me)

# Deploy OS on jump node
maas maas-server machine deploy gdp33h

# Wait until jump node is deployed

# prepare salt cloud profile for jump node
# /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/joid.conf
