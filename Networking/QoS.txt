Medianet QoS Design Strategy

end user Quality of Service (QoS) rating as defined in ITU-T
   Recommendation G.1010
    Here is a short explanation of the end user QoS category as defined
   in ITU-T Recommendation G.1010.  User traffic is divided into four
   different categories, namely, interactive, responsive, timely, and
   non-critical.  An example of interactive traffic is between two
   humans and is most sensitive to delay, loss, and jitter.  Another
   example of interactive traffic is between two servers where very low
   delay and loss are needed.  Responsive traffic is typically between a
   human and a server but can also be between two servers.  Responsive
   traffic is less affected by jitter and can tolerate longer delays
   than interactive traffic.  Timely traffic is either between servers
   or servers and humans and the delay tolerance is significantly longer
   than responsive traffic.  Non-critical traffic is normally between
   servers/machines where delivery may be delay for period of time.

RFC 4594        Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes      August 2006
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4594
Updated by: 5865

    The following are some traffic conditioners
   that may be used in deployment of differentiated services:
      o  For Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB, a single token bucket meter to
      provide a rate plus burst size control.
   
   The Assured Forwarding PHB [RFC2597] ... is intended for networks that offer
   average-rate Service Level Agreements (SLAs)...
   traffic is expected to
   be "elastic" in nature.  The receiver will detect loss or variation
   in delay in the network and provide feedback such that the sender
   adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available capacity.
   
   The intent of Expedited Forwarding PHB [RFC3246] is to provide a
   building block for low-loss, low-delay, and low-jitter services.
   traffic remains
   subject to loss due to line errors and reordering during routing
   changes.  However, using queuing techniques, the probability of delay
   or variation in delay is minimized.
   To protect the network, at minimum one SHOULD police traffic at
   various points to ensure that the design of a queue is not overrun,
   and then the traffic SHOULD be given a low-delay queue (often using
   priority, although it is asserted that a rate-based queue can do
   this) to ensure that variation in delay is not an issue, to meet
   application needs.
   
   1.5.5.  Admission Control
   For VoIP (telephony) service, a common approach is to use signaling
   protocols such as SIP, H.323, H.248, MEGACO, and Resource Reservation
   Protocol (RSVP) to negotiate admittance and use of network transport
   capabilities.
   When a user has been authorized to send voice traffic,
   this admission procedure has verified that data rates will be within
   the capacity of the network that it will use.  Many RTP voice
   payloads are inelastic and cannot react to loss or delay in any
   substantive way.  For these voice payloads, the network SHOULD police
   at ingress to ensure that the voice traffic stays within its
   negotiated bounds.  Having thus assured a predictable input rate, the
   network may use a priority queue to ensure nominal delay and
   variation in delay.
   Another approach that may be used in small and bandwidth-constrained
   networks for limited number of flows is RSVP [RFC2205] [RFC2996].
   However, there is concern with the scalability of this solution in
   large networks where aggregation of reservations [RFC3175] is
   considered to be required.

    2.  Service Differentiation
    2.1.  Service Classes
      o  Real-Time Interactive service class is intended for interactive
      variable rate inelastic applications that require low jitter and
      loss and very low delay, such as interactive gaming applications
      that use RTP/UDP streams for game control commands, and video
      conferencing applications that do not have the ability to change
      encoding rates or to mark packets with different importance
      indications.
   Comment from Cisco's qosmrn.pdf
        Whenever technically possible and
        administratively feasible, data sub-components of
        this class can be separated out and assigned to the
        УTransactional DataФ traffic class. Traffic in this class
        should be marked CS4 and may be provisioned with
        an EF PHB; as such, admission to this class should be
        controlled. An example application is Cisco
        TelePresence.

      o  "sr+bs" represents a policing mechanism that provides single rate
      with burst size control.

4.4.  Real-Time Interactive Service Class

   The Real-Time Interactive service class is RECOMMENDED for
   applications that require low loss and jitter and very low delay for
   variable rate inelastic traffic sources.  Interactive gaming and
   video conferencing applications that do not have the ability to
   change encoding rates or to mark packets with different importance



Babiarz, et al.              Informational                     [Page 37]
 
RFC 4594        Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes      August 2006


   indications are such applications.  The traffic sources in this
   traffic class do not have the ability to reduce their transmission
   rate according to feedback received from the receiving end.

   Typically, applications in this service class are configured to
   negotiate the setup of RTP/UDP control session.  When a user/end-
   point has been authorized to start a new session, the admission
   procedure should have verified that the newly admitted data rates
   will be within the engineered capacity of the Real-Time Interactive
   service class.  The bandwidth in the core network and the number of
   simultaneous Real-time Interactive sessions that can be supported
   SHOULD be engineered to control traffic load for this service.

   The Real-Time Interactive service class SHOULD use the Class Selector
   (CS) PHB, defined in [RFC2474].  This service class SHOULD be
   configured to provide a high assurance for bandwidth for CS4 marked
   packets to ensure that they get forwarded.  The Real-Time Interactive
   service class SHOULD be configured to use a Rate Queuing system such
   as that defined in Section 1.4.1.2 of this document.  Note that this
   service class MAY be configured as a second EF PHB that uses relaxed
   performance parameter, a rate scheduler, and CS4 DSCP value.

   The following applications SHOULD use the Real-Time Interactive
   service class:

   o  Interactive gaming and control.
   o  Video conferencing applications without rate control or traffic
      content importance marking.
   o  IP VPN service that specifies single rate and mean network delay
      that is slightly longer then network propagation delay.
   o  Inelastic, interactive, time-critical, and mission-critical
      applications requiring very low delay.

   The following are traffic characteristics:

   o  Variable size packets.
   o  Variable rate, non-bursty.
   o  Application is sensitive to delay variation between flows and
      sessions.
   o  Lost packets, if any, are usually ignored by application.

   RECOMMENDED DSCP marking:

   o  All flows in this service class are marked with CS4 (Class
      Selector 4).
      Applications or IP end points SHOULD pre-mark their packets with CS4
   DSCP value.  If the end point is not capable of setting the DSCP
   value, then the router topologically closest to the end point SHOULD
   perform Multifield (MF) Classification, as defined in [RFC2475].

   RECOMMENDED conditioning performed at DiffServ network edge:

   o  Packet flow marking (DSCP setting) from untrusted sources (end
      user devices) SHOULD be verified at ingress to DiffServ network
      using Multifield (MF) Classification methods defined in [RFC2475].
   o  Packet flows from untrusted sources (end user devices) SHOULD be
      policed at ingress to DiffServ network, e.g., using single rate
      with burst size token bucket policer to ensure that the traffic
      stays within its negotiated or engineered bounds.
   o  Packet flows from trusted sources (application servers inside
      administered network) MAY not require policing.
   o  Policing of packet flows across peering points SHOULD be performed
      to the Service Level Agreement (SLA).

   The fundamental service offered to "Real-Time Interactive" traffic is
   enhanced best-effort service with controlled rate and delay.  The
   service SHOULD be engineered so that CS4 marked packet flows have
   sufficient bandwidth in the network to provide high assurance of
   delivery.  Normally, traffic in this service class does not respond
   dynamically to packet loss.  As such, Active Queue Management
   [RFC2309] SHOULD NOT be applied to CS4 marked packet flows.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5865#page-7
at access network speeds, [RFC4594] recommends the separation of video and voice into separate queues, while at optical speeds, [RFC5127] recommends that they use a common queue.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2697
The Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) meters an IP packet stream
   and marks its packets either green, yellow, or red.  Marking is based
   on a Committed Information Rate (CIR) and two associated burst sizes,
   a Committed Burst Size (CBS) and an Excess Burst Size (EBS).  A
   packet is marked green if it doesn't exceed the CBS, yellow if it
   does exceed the CBS, but not the EBS, and red otherwise.  The srTCM
   is useful, for example, for ingress policing of a service, where only
   the length, not the peak rate, of the burst determines service
   eligibility.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2698
Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) meters an IP packet stream and marks 
   its packets based on two rates, Peak Information Rate (PIR) and
   Committed Information Rate (CIR), and their associated burst sizes to
   be either green, yellow, or red.  A packet is marked red if it
   exceeds the PIR.  Otherwise it is marked either yellow or green
   depending on whether it exceeds or doesn't exceed the CIR.
