ISIS vs OSPF
https://workshops.nsrc.org/dokuwiki/_media/2016/rwandanog-routing/08-isis-vs-ospf.pdf
OSPF: Suits ISPs with central high speed core network linking regional PoPs
ISIS: Suits ISPs with “stringy” networks, diverse infrastructure, etc, not fitting central core model of OSPF

Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) is a Layer 3 protocol similar to IP version 4 (IPv4) for linking hosts (end systems) with routers (intermediate systems) in an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network.

Level 1 systems route within an area. When the destination is outside an area, Level 1 systems route toward a Level 2 system. 
Level 2 intermediate systems route between areas and toward other ASs.
IS-IS routers can act as both Level 1 and Level 2 routers, sharing intra-area routes with other Level 1 routers and interarea routes with other Level 2 routers.

OSPF uses IP Protocol 89 as transport
IS-IS is directly encapsulated in Layer 2

In ISO terminology, packets are referred to as Protocol Data Units (PDUs). There are 3 categories of IS-IS packets:
	IS-IS Hello Packets (IIHs): These packets establish and maintain adjacencies between IS-IS neighbors.
		Two kinds of IS-IS hellos PDUs exist: LAN hello PDUs and point-to-point hello PDUs. 
		The LAN hello PDUs can be divided further into Level 1 and Level 2 hello PDUs. 
		The format of the two types of LAN hello PDUs is identical.
		By default, a DIS router sends hello packets every 3 seconds, and a non-DIS router sends hello packets every 9 seconds.
	Link State PDUs (LSPs): These packets are responsible to distribute routing information between IS-IS nodes.
		The 1-byte PDU type field denotes whether the PDU is Level 1 (value 18) or Level 2 PDU (value 20).
			With this exception as well as different multicast destination addresses, the PDU contents and formats are identical to each other.
		The IS-IS LSPs are flooded when either a network change occurs or often enough to keep the database from having stale information. 
		Each LSP has a 2-byte field named the remaining lifetime. 
    Each IS-IS router initializes this field to a certain value when the LSP is created. 
		By default, this timer value is set to 1200 seconds, or 20 minutes. Each router takes this value and begins a countdown toward 0. 
		Before the timer expires (at approximately 317 seconds), the originating system regenerates the LSP and floods it to all its neighbors.
	Sequence Number PDUs (SNPs): These packets control the distribution of LSPs. SNPs provide mechanism to synchronize LSDBs between routers in the same area.
		CSNP
			CSNPs contain a complete description of all LSPs in the IS-IS database.
			The DIS periodically multicast Complete SNP (CSNP) to describe all the LSPs in the Pseudonode database. 
			L1 CSNPs are sent to all Level-1 ISs multicast address 01-80-C2-00-00-14, while 
			L2 CSNPs are sent to all Level-2 ISs multicast address 01-80-C2-00-00-15.
		PSNP
			A receiver multicasts partial sequence number PDUs (PSNPs) when it detects that it is missing an LSP or when its LSP database is out of date. 
			The receiver sends a PSNP to the system that transmitted the complete sequence number PDUs (CSNPs), 
			effectively requesting that the missing LSP be transmitted. That router, in turn, forwards the missing LSP to the requesting router.

Unlike RIP and OSPF, IS-IS does not require a distinct protocol or a new version to support IPv6. 
	Because IS-IS uses ISO addresses, the configuration for IPv6 and IPv4 is identical in the Junos OS implementation of IS-IS. 
	For IS-IS to carry IPv6 routes, you only need to add IPv6 addresses to IS-IS enabled interfaces or include other IPv6 routes in your IS-IS export policy.
	The only explicit configuration needed in IS-IS with regard to IPv6 is if you want to disable it. 
  
IS-IS Level 1 internal routes are redistributed into the Level 2 database by default.
To provide interarea reachability for Level 1 routers, an L1/L2 router with a Level 2 adjacency to a router in another area sets its attached bit in its Level 1 LSPs. 
	Level 1 routers install a 0.0.0.0/0 default route to the metrically closest attached router when they detect Level 1 LSPs with the attached bit set.
By default, external routes are not leaked between the Level 1 database and the Level 2 database
Level 1 routes advertised as external routes into Level 1 are not advertised to any Level 2 routers by default; 
	routing policy is needed to effect the leaking of Level 1 externals into the L2 backbone.
	the use of wide-metrics-only alters the natural L1/L2 boundary in that routes are no longer distinguishable as being internal or external. 
	The use of wide metrics therefore results in the automatic leaking of all Level 1 routes into Level 2, because they will all appear to be internal routes.
Route leaking
	Because the L1/L2 border router naturally stops the transmission of Level 2 routes into a Level 1 area, it is the logical location to override that default. 
		You can accomplish this goal with a Junos routing policy.
	The potential for route leaking-induced routing loops is averted by a bit in the LSP known as the up/down (U/D) bit. 
	The purpose of this bit is to inform the L1/L2 routers whether a configured policy can advertise a route.
	Only routes marked with the up direction are eligible for advertisement from Level 1 to Level 2. All internal Level 1 routes will have the up/down bit set in this manner.

"internal/external" is a bit field in the ISIS TLV 128/130 (narrow-metric) and TLV 135 (for wide-metric). 
In TLV 135 the field name is actually (UP/DOWN). 
Up means it can be "leaked" to another area, down means it won't be "leaked" to another area, this is to prevent routing loop.
