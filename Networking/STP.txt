Default bridge priority: 32768
ID: 32768.MAC. In VLAN 10: 32778.MAC
Cost (PVST):
	10Gbps -> 2
	1 Gbps -> 4
	100 Mbps -> 19
	10 Mbps -> 100
Root path cost: 
	From Root Bridge it will send BPDU with cost to Root Bridge as “0”. 
	When this BPDU receive by any other switch it will add its own port cost (according to the above mentioned value). 
	So if BPDU receive by a Fast Ethernet port (100 Mbps) it will calculate path cost to root as 19 (0+19).
If same root path cost:
	1. Lowest Sending Bridge ID
	2. Lowest Port Priority (of sender)
	3. Lowest Interface number (of sender)

802.1d:
	Port states:
		Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding
	Convergence:
		As a port is enabled, it must transition through the listening and learning states
		before graduating to the forwarding state. 
		STP allows two times the forwarding delay (15 seconds by default) for this transition to occur.
	Reconvergence:
		Approximately 50 seconds: 
			20 seconds for a BPDU to age out, 15 seconds for the listening state, and 15 seconds for the learning state.
		How:
			Switch, which detected failure, sends TCN out root port every 2 seconds until receives TCN ACK (configuration BPDU)
			Upstream switches (on the path too root) do the same 
			Switches in the different tree branches do nothing

STP and RSTP maintain the spanning tree differently. 
	Both use BPDUs to communicate the current tree topology. 
	With STP, the root bridge initiates these messages and they propagate throughout the tree every hello time interval. 
	With RSTP, a non-root bridge sends a BPDU with its current information every hello time interval, 
		regardless of receiving BPDUs from the root bridge.
		RSTP BPDUs act as keepalives: designated ports send Configuration BPDUs every hello time (default of 2 seconds)

RSTP:
	Port roles:
		Root
		Designated
		Alternate (for root port) - alternate path to the root bridge
			Blocks traffic while receiving superior BPDUs from a neighboring switch
		Backup (for designated port) - provides redundant path to a segment (on designated switches only)
			Blocks traffic while a more preferred port functions as the designated port
	Port states:
		Discarding (instead of blocking and listening)
		Learning
		Forwarding
	Convergence:
		Ethernet interfaces operating in full-duplex mode are considered point-to-point links. 
		Proposal-and-agreement handshake on point-to-point links instead of timers.
		Nonedge-designated ports transition to the forwarding state once they receive explicit agreement.
		If a switch port does not receive BPDUs from the connecting device, it automatically assumes the role of an edge port.
		When receives configuration messages, changes to nonedge port.
		Nonedge-designated ports transition to the forwarding state only after receipt of an explicit agreement from the attached switch.
	Reconvergence:
		If a neighboring bridge receives no BPDU withing 3 times the hello interval (3 x 2 = 6 seconds), 
		connectivity to the neighbor is faulty
		When a point-to-point link fails, the alternate link can transition to the forwarding state without waiting 
			for any protocol timers to expire.
		RSTP uses additional features and functionality, such as edge port definitions and 
			rapid direct and indirect link failure detection and recovery.
			RSTP generate TCNs only when nonedge ports transition to the forwarding state. 
				Nonedge ports are typically defined as ports that interconnect switches.
			RSTP also provides improved network stability because it does not generate a TCN when a port
				transitions to the discarding state.
			When a TCN is necessary and is generated, the initiating device floods all designated ports as well as the root port.
			Unlike traditional STP, neighboring switches that are not in the path of the initiator to
				the root bridge do not need to wait for this information from the root bridge. As the changes
				propagate throughout the network, the switches flush the majority of the MAC addresses located in
				their bridge tables. The individual switches do not, however, flush MAC addresses learned from their
				locally-configured edge ports or MAC addresses learned from the port through which they received
				the TCN.

Protection:
	BPDU protection
		You can enable BPDU protection on switch interfaces where no BPDUs are expected. 
		If a protected interface receives BPDUs, the switch disables the interface and stops forwarding frames by 
		transitioning the interface to a blocking state.
	The loop protection feature protects against Layer 2 loops by preventing the non-designated ports from becoming designated ports.
