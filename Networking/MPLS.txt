MPLS FAQ from Cisco - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls/mpls/4649-mpls-faq-4649.html

MPLS shim header - 32 bit:
  Label - 20 bit
  Traffic class (formerly Experimental bits) - 3 bit
  Bottom-of-stack - 1 bit. Set to 1 if this is the last label before the payload
  TTL - 8 bit. By default IP TTL is copied.

Reserved labels:
  0 - IPv4 Explicit NULL. Label stack must be popped, and the packet forwarding must be based on the IPv4 header. 
    This helps to keep Exp bits safe until the egress router. It is used in MPLS based QoS
  1 - Router Alert
  2 - IPv6 Explicit NULL. Label stack must be popped, and the packet forwarding must be based on the IPv6 header.
  3 - Implicit NULL. Internal label, only used withing signaling protocols (MPLS frames are never sent with label value 3).
    Egress LSR initially send a special label value of 3 to “next-to-last LSR” (called the penultimate LSR). 
    When an LSR receives an MPLS header in which the label is set to 3, it always POPs the header i.e., it removes the top label.

LDP
  Follows best IGP path, so does not allow traffic engineering
  Now used mainly by applications, requiring full mesh of LSP between routers
  
RSVP
  Allows traffic engineering, reserving bandwidth along the path
  Uses IP as its network layer (protocol number 46)
  Message types:
    Path: create or periodic refresh for an LSP
    Resv: reserve resources
    PathTear: remove path and corresponding reservation
    ResvTear: remove reservation
    PathErr: error message sent upstream to sender
    ResvErr: error message sent downstream
  RSVP LSP establishment:
    Ingress router sends PATH message; the PATH message is forwarded towards egress, creating a state on every router as it traverses
      Some objects in the PATH messag:
        Session ID
        Session attributes: priority, preemtion, link/node protection
        Sender T_Spec: requested bandwidth reservation
        RSVP hop: the previous hop the PATH message traversed
        Label request: request for label binding
        Record route: nodes, traversed by the LSP
        Explicit route object: specify the path the LSP should take
    Once the PATH message reaches the egress LSR, a RESV message, which includes the allocated label, is sent back towards the ingress.
      Each transit router, receiving a RESV message, allocates a new local label, relay it upstream, and install new entry in the LIB.
        E.g. egress LSR assigns label 3 (asks the PHP remove the label), PHP asks previous router to use label 5432 to reach him...
        Objects, includes in the RESV message:
          Session ID
          Label: label, allocated by the previous hop
          STYLE: reservation style (FF, SE)
          Record route: nodes and interfaces traversed
          RSVP-hop: the IP address of the previous hop
