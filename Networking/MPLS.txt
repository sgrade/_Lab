MPLS FAQ from Cisco - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls/mpls/4649-mpls-faq-4649.html

MPLS header - 32 bit:
  Label - 20 bit
  Traffic class (formerly Experimental bits) - 3 bit
  Bottom-of-stack - 1 bit. Set to 1 if this is the last label before the payload
  TTL - 8 bit. By default IP TTL is copied.
Reserved labels:
  0 - IPv4 Explicit NULL. Label stack must be popped, and the packet forwarding must be based on the IPv4 header. 
    This helps to keep Exp bits safe until the egress router. It is used in MPLS based QoS
  1 - Router Alert
  2 - IPv6 Explicit NULL. Label stack must be popped, and the packet forwarding must be based on the IPv6 header.
  3 - Implicit NULL. Egress LSR initially send a special label value of 3 to “next-to-last LSR” (called the penultimate LSR). 
    When an LSR receives an MPLS header in which the label is set to 3, it always POPs the header i.e., it removes the top label.
