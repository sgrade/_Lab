ISIS vs OSPF
https://workshops.nsrc.org/dokuwiki/_media/2016/rwandanog-routing/08-isis-vs-ospf.pdf
OSPF: Suits ISPs with central high speed core network linking regional PoPs
ISIS: Suits ISPs with “stringy” networks, diverse infrastructure, etc, not fitting central core model of OSPF

DIS election - if priority same, highest SNPA (Subnetwork Point of Attachment - MAC) wins

Cisco config:
router isis
net 49.0001.aabb.cc00.4800.00
    e.g. 
        49 - private
        0001 - area ID
        aabb.cc00.4800 - MAC address (Juniper recommends using IP address instead (add 0s when needed))
        00 - network selector (should be 0)
is-type level-1-2
    or
        level-1
        level-2-only
interface fa0/1
ip router isis
int lo 0
ip router isis
end

show ip route isis
show clns is-neighbors

"internal/external" is a bit field in the ISIS TLV 128/130 (narrow-metric) and TLV 135 (for wide-metric). 
In TLV 135 the field name is actually (UP/DOWN). 
Up means it can be "leaked" to another area, down means it won't be "leaked" to another area, this is to prevent routing loop.

show isis route
show route protocol isis
show isis database extensive
show isis database extensive | find tlv

Level 1 route [IS-IS/15]
Level 2 route [IS-IS/18]

By default, external routes are not leaked between the Level 1 database and the Level 2 database
IS-IS Level 1 internal routes are redistributed into the Level 2 database by default.
