L3 unicast routing for all traffic, with ECMP for balancing traffic across links, using BGP to configure the routes throughout the network. 
We do not support multicast traffic within our data center, nor do we use features such as L2 overlays, spanning tree, or even trunking.

Specifically, the FBOSS agent includes support for:
Programming various tables within the Broadcom ASIC, such as L2, L3, and VLAN tables.
Handling low-level control packets for host and neighbor learning (ARP, IPv6 NDP, DHCPv4/v6 relay, LLDP).
Packet parsing/construction of ICMP/UDP packets.

ICMP, warm boot
