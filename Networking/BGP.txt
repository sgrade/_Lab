TCP port 179
Idle
Connect - BGP is waiting for the transport protocol connection to be completed
	If OK, send Open message, changes to OpenSent
	If fails, restarts the ConnectRetryTimer, listens for incoming connections, changes to Active
Active - initiating a transport protocol connection
	If OK, send Open message, changes to OpenSent
	If the local systemТs BGP state remains in the Active state, you should check physical connectivity as well as the configuration on both peers
OpenSent - BGP waits for an OPEN message from its peer
	When received, it is checked and verified to ensure that no errors exist. 
	If an error is detected, back to Idle. 
	If no errors are detected, BGP sends a Keepalive message.
OpenConfirm - BGP waits for a KEEPALIVE or NOTIFICATION message.
	If no KEEPALIVE received before the negotiated hold timer expires, the local system sends a NOTIFICATION message stating that the hold timer has expired 
		and changes its state to Idle. 
	If receives NOTIFICATION message, Idle. 
	If receives KEEPALIVE message, Established.
Established - BGP can exchange UPDATE, NOTIFICATION, and KEEPALIVE messages with its peer
	When receives UPDATE or KEEPALIVE message, and negotiated hold timer value is nonzero, it restarts its hold timer.
	If the negotiated hold timer reaches zero, the local system sends out a KEEPALIVE message and restarts the hold timer.

ƒл€ каждого соседа может быть указано уникальное значение таймеров keepalive и hold. 
	BGP выполн€ет проверку таймеров keepalive и hold, однако несовпадение этих параметров не вли€ет на установку отношений соседства.
	≈сли выбранное значение таймера Hold равно нулю, то сообщени€ Keepalive отправл€тьс€ не будут.

Ёто вз€л из статьи Riot, но не уверен, что правильно. ѕутают причину с BGP dampening?
	BGP session age, a measure of how long a particular route has been in use. 
	Imagine two routes between Riot and a particular ISP: a faster route A and a slower route B. 
	If route A goes down, the traffic moves to route B certainly a reasonable shift as it's the best available route. 
	The problem occurs when route A comes back up as the ISP will continue to use route B simply because its session age is older, 
	and therefore automatically preferred. 
	This is done because it's the default behavior of the protocol, 
	and for ISPs with large amounts of peers it requires less work than manually rebalancing to the correct route. 
	We've had to find workarounds such as taking route B down intentionally to move that traffic back to route A.

RFC 1997               BGP Communities Attribute             August 1996
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1997
Well-known Communities
   The following communities have global significance and their
   operations shall be implemented in any community-attribute-aware BGP
   speaker.
      NO_EXPORT (0xFFFFFF01)
         All routes received carrying a communities attribute
         containing this value MUST NOT be advertised outside a BGP
         confederation boundary (a stand-alone autonomous system that
         is not part of a confederation should be considered a
         confederation itself).
      NO_ADVERTISE (0xFFFFFF02)
         All routes received carrying a communities attribute
         containing this value MUST NOT be advertised to other BGP
         peers.
      NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED (0xFFFFFF03)
         All routes received carrying a communities attribute
         containing this value MUST NOT be advertised to external BGP
         peers (this includes peers in other members autonomous
         systems inside a BGP confederation).


RFC 4360           BGP Extended Communities Attribute      February 2006
https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4360.txt
5.  Route Origin Community
   The Route Origin Community identifies one or more routers that inject
   a set of routes (that carry this Community) into BGP.  This is
   transitive across the Autonomous System boundary.
   ...
   One possible use of the Route Origin Community is specified in
   [RFC4364].

RFC 4364                    BGP/MPLS IP VPNs               February 2006
   The Site of Origin attribute, if used, is encoded as a Route Origin
   Extended Community [BGP-EXTCOMM].  The purpose of this attribute is
   to uniquely identify the set of routes learned from a particular
   site.  This attribute is needed in some cases to ensure that a route
   learned from a particular site via a particular PE/CE connection is
   not distributed back to the site through a different PE/CE
   connection.  It is particularly useful if BGP is being used as the
   PE/CE protocol, but different sites have not been assigned distinct
   ASNs.

Timers
    Cisco routers, this defaults to 60 and 180 respectively.
    Quagga config: "timers bgp 4 16" - this command adjusts the network timers for keepalive and holddown timers.
         a keepalive is sent every 4 seconds, and the router should wait 16 seconds for keepalive messages before it declares the peer dead.

         
RFC 4384          BGP Communities for Data Collection      February 2006
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4384

   Communities are also used for a wide
   variety of other applications, such as allowing customers to set
   attributes such as LOCAL_PREF [RFC1771] by sending appropriate
   communities to their service provider.  Other applications include
   signaling various types of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (e.g.,
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS]), and carrying link
   bandwidth for traffic engineering applications [RFC4360].

    2.3.  Peer Routes
   Peer routes are those routes heard from peers via BGP, and not
   propagated to other peers.  In particular, these routes are only
   propagated to the service provider's customers.
    2.4.  Internal Routes
   Internal routes are those routes that a service provider originates
   and passes to its peers and customers.  These routes are frequently
   taken out of the address space allocated to a provider.
    2.6.  Special Purpose Routes
   Special purpose routes are those routes that do not fall into any of
   the other classes described here.  In those cases in which such
   routes need to be distinguished, a service provider may color such
   routes with a unique value.  Examples of special purpose routes
   include anycast routes and routes for overlay networks.
    2.8.  National Routes
   These are route sets that are sourced from and/or received within a
   particular country.
    2.9.  Regional Routes
   Several global backbones implement regional policy based on their
   deployed footprint and on strategic and business imperatives.
   Service providers often have settlement-free interconnections with an
   Autonomous System (AS) in one region, and that same AS is a customer
   in another region.  This mandates use of regional routing, including
   community attributes set by the network in question to allow easy
   discrimination among regional routes.  For example, service providers
   may treat a route set received from another service provider in
   Europe differently than the same route set received in North America,
   as it is common practice to sell transit in one region while peering
   in the other.
   
   This memo follows the best current practice of using the basic format
   <AS>:<Value>.  The values for the route categories are described in
