Special addresses:
	::/0 - default route
	::1/128 - loopback
	0100::/64 - discard

Linux:
	ip -6 addr

Types: 	unicast, multicast, anycase
	Unicast:
		Global: 2000::/3 (it's effectively 2000::/4 and 3000::/4)
		Link-local: fe80::/64
		Unique local: fc::/7. Note: "fc" is reserved, we can use "fd" addresses
	Multicast:
		ff00::/8
			Solicited-node multicast: ff02::1:ff00:0/104
			Link-local all-nodes: ff02::1
	Anycast:
		Anycast addresses are really unicast
		Used in DNS, DHCP, ..., functions, that work anywhere

If a port is required, then put the address in []
	http://[2001:db8:cafe:5150::1]:80

Zone ID - %
	fe80::6085:be82:8442:9b54%4
	2001:db8:cafe:5150::1
	Typically the Zone IS will match the interface ID
	So for a linux system it could be eth0 or en0 on OSX

NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)
	Replaces ARP
	Handles:
		Host address auto configuration
		Discovery of neighbor hosts
		Determining link layer addresses of other hosts 
		Duplicate address detection
		Finding routers (through router advertisements)
		Prefix discovery
		Reachabiity of other hosts
		Note: all of the above work on link layer (on link)
	Defines:
		Router Solicitation
		Router advertisement (RA) - part of NDP
			Automatic way to get the default gateway information
				Note: DHCPv6 does not provide default gateway information, thus RAs are NOT optional
			You can have several routers doing RAs
				If same prefix, one should be given higher preference
				VRRP is an alternative
			RA guard - security option making sure only your router advertises RAs
			Linux:
				can obtain an IPv6 DNS resolver address via DHCPv6 or SLAAC (with RDNSS capabilities)
		Neighbor Solicitation
		Neighbor Advertisement
		Redirect
	Uses Solicited Node, Multicast and ICMPv6
	Host address auto configuration:
		SLAAC
			1. RA from router or
			2. RS from host
			3. RA has A flag
			4. Host learns prefix
			5. Host builds address
		Neighbor discovery: NS, NA
		Duplicate address detection: NS from host to solicited node; no reply - host uses address OR conflict - host discards address
	Leverages multicast to allow hosts to discover other hosts
	IPv6 solicited node address - can be built for each IPv6 address on a host
		The last 24 bits on an IPv6 address are appended to the SOLICITED NODE PREFIX
			e.g. ff02::1:ff00:0/104 + 32:6ed3
		Local host OS installs that multicast address on the NIC to listen for traffic
	Services:
		mDNS - Apple, name resolution on a local link without DNS server
		LLMNR - Microsoft, same purpose. E.g. ff02::1:3 - multicast group to do local name resolution
		Router Advertisements
		Router Solicitation - to discover a router
	Example:
		power shell: netsh interface ipv6 show joins 4
	Addresses:
		ff0X::1 - all nodes
			ff01::1 - interface-local all nodes (useful only for loopback transmission of multicast)
			ff02::1 - link-local all nodes (like IPv4 broadcast; spans the same topological region as the corresponding unicast scope)
		ff0X::2 - all routers
			ff01::2 - interface-local all routers
			ff02::2 - link-local all routers
			ff05::2 - site-local all routers
		ff02::5 - OSPF link-local
		ff02::6 - OSPF DRs link-local
		ff02::d - all PIM routers
		ff02::c - link-local Simple Service Discovery Protocol
		ff02::1:3 - LLMNR (link-local Multicast Name Resolution)
		ff02::fb - mDNS (Apple's Bonjour Service)
		ff02::101 - link-local NTP

Ethernet 
	EtherType
		IPv4: 0x0800
		IPv6: 0x86DD
	Multicast MAC
		33:33:xx:xx:xx:xx

Jumbograms - layer 3 function. Through extension 
Often confused with jumbo frames - layer 2 function		
	
Anycast
	Use cases:
		Global Anycast DNS
		HA 
		mitigate DDoS
		stable address services for services
		...
	The closest server answers

ICMPv6
	IPv6 uses ICMPv6 to report errors and messages
	Type and code fields are different from ICMP
	Used:
		Path MTU discovery
			If router has smaller MTU than packet received, it sends "packet too big" ICMPv6 message
		Neighbor discovery
		...
	On MS Windows: 
		ping and tracert are the same
		ping -6 cav6tf.org
			Note: -6 only says that I am only interested in AAAA DNS record
		tracert -6 cav6tf.org
		mtupath -6 cav6tf.org
			Note: mtupath is a 3rd-party tool
		Get-NetIPv6Protocol | select IcmpRedirects, MldLevel, MLdVersion | ft -AutoSize
	Linux:
		ping6 instead of ping
		traceroute -6 option
		ip -6
		ping6 -n -c2 cav6tf.org
		ndisc6 - neighbor discovery tool, not natively installed
			you must specify the interface
			e.g.
			ndisc6 2001:470:1f05:9a4:d532:e510:21f:38f5 eth0
			it will tell what the MAC address is for IPv6 address
			
Subnetting - use natural nibble boundaries (count in increments of 4)
	/48 - 1 subnets - 65536 /64 networks (VLANs)
	/52 - 16 - 4096
	/56 - 256 - 256
	/60 - 4096 - 16
	/64 - 65536 - 1
			
Prefix policy table - defines source address selection
	OS version dependent (two different RFC: 3484 and 6724)
	Windows:
		netsh interface ipv6 show prefixpolicies
	Linux:
		Ubuntu/Debian
			/etc/gai.conf
		CentOS/Redhat
			- blank file

SLAAC - Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
	leaves the hosts the ability to make the autoconfiguration by themselves without the need to communicate to anybody else on the network
	host or router interface is assigned a 64-bit prefix, and then the last 64 bits of its address are derived by the host or router with help of EUI-64 process.
			
DNS
	AAAA (quad A) resolves into IPv6 address
		(Note: A record = 32 bits of IPv6, quad = 4*32 (128 bit))
	PTR - ip6.arpa
		in IPv4 reverse IPv4 zone is in-addr.arpa
		So no special math, just a different DNS zone
	Client IPv6 DNS
		Windows: DNS resolver only obtained via DHCPv6
		Linux: DHCPv6 or SLAAC
		Android: no DHCPv6 client, only SLAAC. Note: should double check if this info is up to date
	Server IPv6 DNS
		multiple servers or daemons
		default behavior is to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6
	DNS tools
		nslookup -type=AAAA cav6tf.org
		dig cav6tf.org AAAA
	Troubleshooting
		ping6, traceroute -6, ifconfig
		Google DNS: 2001:4860:4860::8888, 2001:4860:4860::8844
		OpenDNS: 2620:0:ccd::2
