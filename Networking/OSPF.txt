Mutual redistribution (e.g specific routes from RIP to OSPF, default route from OSPF to RIP)
Redistribution rule:
	Source route has a lower preference:
		- no problem
	Source route has a higher preference:
		- sub-optimal routing
		- routing loops
	E.g. in Juniper RIP has route preference 100, OSPF external (default route) - 150. 
		When default redistributed to RIP and back, RIP version wins - the default route will 
		point to RIP router, but should point to original ASBR in OSPF area. This is a loop.
		To solve, modify route preference of OSPF external to 90 (lower, than RIP)


OSPFv3
The protocol runs per link rather than per subnet
Router and network LSAs do not carry prefix information
Two new LSA types: link-LSA and intra-area-prefix-LSA
Flooding scopes are link-local area and AS
Link-local addresses are used for all neighbor exchanges except virtual links
Two new option bits are included: R and V6
