Option A - back-to-back VRFs
	ASBRs interact as PE-CE
	No MPLS between ASs (Service Providers) (only IP connectivity between ASBRs)
	Unlabeled VPN IPv4
	Sub-interface on on ASBR  per customer; ASBRs need to keep routing table per customer


Option B -
	MPLS between Service Providers (between ASBRs)
	Single-hop MP-EBGP
	MP-eBGP between ASBRs (exchanging VPNv4 routes)
	Labeled VPN IPv4


Option C -
	MPLS between Service Providers
	Multihop MP-EBGP between RRs
	End-to-end LSPs between PEs of different SP
	Sercurity might be a concern, when connecting with another SP, because you need to leak loopback IP addresses of RRs and PEs to another SP
