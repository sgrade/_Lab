Option A - back-to-back VRFs
	No MPLS between Service Providers (only IP connectivity between ASBRs)
	Unlabeled VPN IPv4
	Sub-interface on on ASBR  per customer; ASBRs need to keep routing table per customer
	

Option B - 
	MPLS between Service Providers (between ASBRs)
	Labeled VPN IPv4
	MP-eBGP between ASBRs (exchanging VPNv4 routes)
	
		
Option C - 
	MPLS between Service Providers
	Multihop MP-BGP
	End-to-end LSPs between PEs of different SP
	Sercurity might be a concern, when connecting with another SP, because you need to leak loopback IP addresses of RRs and PEs to another SP\\
