## Grafana
Grafana - UI for analyzing metrics.
Can work with multiple time-series data stores
(Graphite, Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, Elasticserch).
Different query editor for different data source.
Very good to break down complex data.

Grafana v8 introduced streaming capabilities â€“ a way to push data to UI panels in near real-time.
